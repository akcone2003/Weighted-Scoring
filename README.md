# Weighted Scoring System
<br>
As a part of Bruin Sports Analytics Consulting team, we were tasked with creating a weighted scoring system for a high-profile calisthenics competition that assigns a point value for each repetition on each exercise. 
The goal for this was to have each exercise standardized, with an average score for any athlete being 500, and an exception score for any athlete being 1000 (defined as being 3 standard deviations above the mean).
This was done to ensure that an average athlete who is equally strong on all exercises, relative to other athletes, would have the same probability of earning equal points value on each exercise.
